# Gameplay

## Setup

The players start by picking a [character](Cards/Characters.md) to play with.
When all characters have been chosen and named, the team draws the first chapter 
of the [story](Cards/Story.md#beginning).

Once the first chapter is drawn, the map as it's initially known is laid out. 
These are the 10 initial map sections that are already known to the players.
The other 75% of the map is locked for now.

## Beginning

For the first few turns of the game, the players are in "stasis mode"; as we 
first encounter our players, they still live their lives as they have been for 
years.

The [stasis card](Cards/Story/1_Stasis.md) drawn in the setup phase has a quest 
for the players during the first few turns. It's a fairly menial quest, could be 
something like chasing off some birds or cleaning a room. Don't worry, your 
lives will get shaken up soon enough, by then your characters will wish their 
hardest task was watering some horses.

## Turns

We start on the [morning](Turns.md#day--night-cycle) of the first day. 
All the characters we care about right now are on the same tile, so we only have 
to once for the [weather](Weather.md).

When the weather of this morning has been decided, the characters get to choose 
their [actions](Turns.md#actions).
