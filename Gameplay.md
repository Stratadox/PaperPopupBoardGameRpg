# Gameplay

The players start by picking a [species](Cards/Characters.md#species) for their 
character and drawing the first chapter of the [story](Cards/Story.md#beginning).

Once the first chapter is drawn, the known map is laid out. 
These are the 10 initial map sections that are already known to the players.
The other 75% of the map is locked for now.
