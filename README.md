# Paper Pop-up Board Game RPG

How's that for a working title?

## Basics

### Paper Pop-up

A board game with animated 3D graphics? Say what? Yep.

### Board Game RPG

The game is set in a world that allows for a myriad of different storylines, 
themes, main goals and side quests.

## Goals

### As a game

A video-game-like board game with three-dimensional graphics, and a compelling 
storyline that's different in each match. 

Maps, stories and enemies are randomly "generated" through dice and card stacks. 
Graphics are made out of paper, animated by popping up when opening the cards 
and through pull-strips and occasional turning wheels.

For the ultimate experience, the very opening of the box that contains the game 
triggers a detailed popup that sets the mood and presents a "Stratadox Presents" 
banner.

> I want full immersion. They have to be **in** there. They influence the game, 
> the game influences them. They get to party if they win... When their 
> characters die, they cry. 

### As a player

Players ultimately strive for a place on their local [leaderboard](Leaderboard.md). 
There are two separate high-score tables a player can aim for: the individual 
score, per character, and the team score.

The players work together as a team to fulfil their quest. Quests are randomly 
assigned based on the [storyline](Cards/Story.md) that applies to the match. 
Without fulfilling the main quest, players stand little chance of making it to 
either board.

## Gameplay

By drawing cards, throwing dice and making tactical and strategic decisions, the 
characters explore the game world to fulfil their main- and side quests.

The players start by picking a character and drawing the first chapter of the 
story. For more details, see the [gameplay section](Gameplay.md).
