# Background

The [world](Cards/World.md) has many randomized elements, but the main backstory 
of the universe will be shared among matches. 

This document outlines the main world building effort for the background of the 
shared parts of the universe.

## Gods and religions

We're concerned with two major "religions" in this game; those loyal to the gods, 
and demon worshippers.

### In our kingdom

Religion is widespread and important and widespread in this world. 
Each province of the Kingdom where our players live has at least one 
[temple](Cards/World.md#temple).

> The gods themselves haven't visited this world for generations. Only the 
> stories of those days survived, but they have doubtlessly been changed quite 
> a lot over the years. The tales have been exaggerated wildly over campfire 
> sessions, that's how things go in a society where most knowledge is spread by 
> word-of-mouth. 
> 
> What we do know from those days is far from pretty. When powerful gods are 
> fighting the darkest demons the world has ever seen, the common folk don't 
> stand much of a chance. Plenty a noble species passed to legend in those days.

> In the temples, we keep written records, of course. Temples, however, tend to

> Luckily, temple records get corrected once every so often. The gods may have

> Their representatives are very much present in this world. 
> 
> We call them [godlings](Cards/NPCs.md#godlings). They are the ones who can 
> communicate with the gods on our behalf. They keep insisting it's not through 
> magic, but how else could they talk with someone so far away?
> 
> Although we don't see them often, with their immense knowledge and power they 
> guide us and often help us in times of extreme need. 
> That doesn't mean we're saved, not at all... Even the godlings can't always 
> protect us from [demons](Cards/Enemies.md#demons). Sometimes, it feels like 
> we're just pawns in some greater scheme.

### The intergalactic perspective

These "godlings" are actually Gordelins, from the planet Gordelin. 
They are the ones that protect the kingdom in the name of the Naï'ru, who are 
regarded as gods by the locals.

The term "demon" is short for warriors of Munde Moné, the rulers of the slave 
colony that spans a large portion of this world. They are vassals of the Kralán, 
enemies of the Naï'ru.

Our game takes place in a border province of a kingdom that is an outpost of 
minor importance to the Gordelins, on a planet that is of even less importance 
to the Naï'ru.

Demons are getting bolder, godlings are getting rarer. The place is important to 
our players, though, so we should probably do something about his mess.

For more detail on the intergalactic perspective, see the [background document 
on gods](Gods.md).

## Power Structure

Godlings may call it an outpost, to us it's a kingdom, and a proud one at that. 
Our Royal family has been in power for countless generations. 
We're a great influence in the region.

### Kingdom

This kingdom is ruled by the Royal House. They are the wise folk who, advised by 
the godlings, decide what's good for the country. Several counts, viscounts, 
archdukes and barons also play some part in this Royal scheme.

### Province

The country is divided into provinces. Ours is a border province, ruled by a 
brave duke who isn't afraid of the dark tower to the west. 

### Sections

Provinces are further split up into sections. Each section is about 20 by 20 cm 
large and fits on your gaming table.

## History

Who remembers it anyway?
