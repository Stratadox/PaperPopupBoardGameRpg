# Adventures

Adventure cards have a set of prerequisites on their back side, as well as an 
optional importance indicator.

When drawing for an adventure card, look at the top 5 cards of the pile. 
Draw the first card that has the highest importance with matching prerequisites.

If none of the cards have matching prerequisites, shuffle the adventure deck and 
redraw.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites are indicated in the form of icons on the back-side of adventure 
cards. 

Common prerequisites involve [terrain types](World.md#sections) and/or 
[weather](../Weather.md). They may get more complex, such as distance to a place,
the group having a particular [quest](Story/3_Quest.md), some specific 
[theme](Story/0_Theme.md) applying or any combination of those.

## Importance

If not indicated, the importance of the card is equal to the number of different 
prerequisites the card has. When importance is indicated, it overrules the 
prerequisite count.
