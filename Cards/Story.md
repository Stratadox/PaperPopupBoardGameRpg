# Story

For maximum replay value, the game's backstory is made from a mostly randomized 
walk over the story tree. Such a walk results in 8 story cards ("Chapters") per 
game, each representing a point of the "Eight-Point Arc":

## Chapters

- [Stasis](Story/1_Stasis.md)
- [Trigger](Story/2_Trigger.md)
- [Quest](Story/3_Quest.md)
- [Surprise](Story/4_Surprise.md)
- [Choice](Story/5_Choice.md)
- [Climax](Story/6_Climax.md)
- [Reversal](Story/7_Reversal.md)
- [Resolution](Story/8_Resolution.md)

@todo: or just give 'm a quest & let the story go free from there?

## Beginning

Draw a "Chapter 1" card. This can be either one of:

1. [The Scullion](Story/1_Stasis.md#the-scullion)
1. [The Farmer](Story/1_Stasis.md#the-farmer)
1. [The Scoundrel](Story/1_Stasis.md#the-scoundrel)
1. [The Initiate](Story/1_Stasis.md#the-initiate)
1. [The Merchant](Story/1_Stasis.md#the-merchant)
1. [The Smith](Story/1_Stasis.md#the-smith)
