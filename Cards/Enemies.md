# Enemy Cards

## Enemy Types

### Demons

The main causes of all evils in this world.

### Corrupted

Each playable species is corruptible by demons, and with all the demons around, 
each species will have members that have already been corrupted.

When encountering a corrupted spirit, it will seek out it's kin. For instance, 
if you encounter a corrupted elf, it will try to corrupt the elf on your team, 
if you have any. A corrupted goblin will try to convert the goblin and murder 
the others, etc.
