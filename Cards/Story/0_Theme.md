# Theme

Each match has a core theme. 

Which theme applies to the match is determined when the [quest](3_Quest.md) 
unfolds. Some [stasis](1_Stasis.md) cards might influence the theme in 
particular cases.

The story's theme determines how certain types of actions are scored. It may 
influence the difficulty level of enemies, the quantities of resources found or 
the possible [surprises](4_Surprise.md) along the way.

Several main themes are available:

## Glory

> We live mundane lives, but yearn for glory, wherever it's found. 

Rule changes:
- Reset [scoring](../../Score.md#score-points) rules
- All non-[hero](../../Score.md#hero-score) score counts half (rounded down).
- [Hero](../../Score.md#hero-score) score counts double.
- [wealth](../../Score.md#wealth-bonus) bonus counts double.

## Community

> Our community is being threatened! We'll try to keep them safe.

Rule changes:
- Individual- and team score are altered at the end of the match:
