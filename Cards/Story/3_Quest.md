# Quest Cards

Some need arises from the trigger, which results in the player starting a 
journey to fulfil that need.

## Starvation

- New main goal: Find food.
- New objective: Reach the [city](../World.md#city-section). 
- Theme: [Survival](0_Theme.md#survival).

> Without reserves, and no way to harvest those ruined crops, this community is
> in serious trouble. We've survived plenty of hardship over the years, but this
> situation is not like those. We'll need a miracle for this one. At least one, 
> probably more than that... At the very least, we need to do *something*! We 
> have elderly and children to care for, and no way to feed them. It's going to 
> be up to us, the few remaining able-bodied, to do something - and fast. 
> Otherwise, this place won't last through winter.
> 
> The small band had had to set the minds of the others at ease... No, they were 
> not abandoning them. Yes, they would find food and return. Of course, they 
> would be careful. They had planned to leave early in the morning, with the 
> lengthy goodbyes it had turned midday before they were on the road. A year's 
> worth of food for the whole community... Their task seemed almost impossible. 
> How would they get that much? There might be food in the city, but what would 
> we trade it for? We almost reached the city, when we encountered...

## Defence

- New main goal: Recruit defenders. 
- New objective: Reach the [city](../World.md#city-section).

    - 5/6: [Glory](0_Theme.md#glory).

> This region is being terrorized more and more, and this place is utterly
> defenceless. Most of the people here couldn't defend themselves if their lives
> depended on it... the location is great for farming, but strategically the 
> place is a sitting duck. The enemy can approach from any direction, without 
> anyone here ever noticing before it's far too late. All that remain will have 
> to figure out some kind of way to put up a defence. With everything that has 
> been happening, this place won't survive without.
> 
> They have all left. The army is far away, the community is but a shadow of 
> what it once was. Except for us, a few close friends who grew up here, those 
> still here are those too weak to leave. It's been days since we heard the news;
> rumours have spread, fear has taken root. To our small group, running away is 
> simply not an option. Yet leave we must, albeit to somehow recruit the right 
> people to organise a defence of this place. We were on the road now, but we'd 
> return! To our biggest surprise, on our way to the city, we met...

> I can't say any of us really cared for why they had done it. The one and only 
> thing on our minds was to take revenge. Vengeance for the fallen, justice for 
> the world and protection for their future victims. Those were the words of our 
> oath. Now we, the survivors of this slaughter, were bound by blood and by our 
> honour to fulfill it, lest our souls be cursed forever. It's an honourable 
> goal, is it not, to avenge your friends? A quest to live for. A quest to die 
> for, if need be! We'd never give up.
> 
> First, we had to come up with a plan. We couldn't simply barge in and attack 
> them: we wouldn't win that battle - and even if we could, we didn't know where 
> they were. What we did know was that our first step had to be training. Once 
> we'd find them, we'd be ready: trained warriors, mages or assassins. Which 
> skills we'd learn, we didn't know yet. They'd have to be deadly ones. We'd 
> heard the stories about the dangers of the city, and decided to face them, to 
> learn from them. When we entered the city, we suddenly recognised...

> Before we go, there's a little formality we'll have to go through. Last month, 
> the royal palace has issued an edict. Here, see: All eligible persons between 
> the ages of 12 and 40 shall henceforth be summoned to perform their military 
> duty in the name of our majesty. We've been gathering all over, now it's your 
> turns! We'll be putting each of you into uniforms once you've completed basic 
> training. Yes, you heard it right: there's a war coming, and it's going to be 
> glorious!
> 
> Training had started several days ago. The small band of friends was suddenly 
> part of a greater whole. We had to get up even earlier than we were used to, 
> and our entire day was filled with combat exercise. We were exhausted as we 
> went to sleep, and even more so as we were rudely awakened every morning. It 
> wasn't long before we started interacting with others in our group. Most of 
> them had been poor working class folks, like ourselves. One morning, to our 
> great surprise, we got introduced to...

> spreading rapidly, it just hadn't reached us yet. We'd heard some rumours, we
> knew the relationships with our neighbours was deteriorating... Still, we
> never saw *this* coming. An invasion? How did they muster that kind of force?
> Wasn't their entire army demolished during the war of the four crowns? Well,
> all those unanswered questions would have to wait; nobody had the answers
> anyway, and we had to act.

> The Royal Princess, the symbol of our nation, beloved all over the land, had 
> gone missing. The palace assumed a kidnapping. No ransom note had yet been 
> delivered - the rider had left shortly after they noticed she wasn't in her 
> chambers, so that might still come. If the deepest fears were real, no such 
> note would ever arrive... The Master of the Dark Tower did not send notes.

> Or, like last time, a head.
