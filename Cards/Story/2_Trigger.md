# Trigger Cards

Something beyond the control of the player is the trigger which sparks off the
story.

## Bandits

Enter bandits.
Change fields into trampled fields, buildings into burning buildings.

> ...A band of mean-looking, heavily armed thugs approach! Are those bandits?
> Here? What in the world! We're in no way prepared to put up that kind of
> fight... Oh, spare us! But no sorrow was to be found that day. The vicious
> gang took what they deemed useful or pretty, killed what resisted and burned
> what remained. When they finally left, the community was in utter ruins. The
> once lively square was decorated with corpses, buildings were on fire and
> fields were left trampled.

## Army

Enter the army.

> ...That uniformed fellow walks over. What could **he** want? More importantly,
> where did all those soldiers suddenly come from? While the sergeant approached,
> the soldiers formed ranks across the yard. Oh, how impressive they looked, all 
> uniformed and shining. Moving in unison, they saluted their sergeant and pinned 
> their halberds into the ground. The sudden "thud" made by the synchronized 
> movement made the nearby chickens scatter in fear. "We'll be off to war soon", 
> said the sergeant, "however..."

## Messenger

Enter nightly messenger.

> ...A rider approaches. They're wearing official messenger colours... How odd,
> the messenger service always schedules their trips in such a way that their
> folks never have to travel after darkness falls. The sun has gone down hours
> ago, they must be in some kind of terrible haste. As the rider hurried nearer,
> I noticed an arrow was pierced through their left shoulder. Worried and
> anxious, I ran to grab the stranger as they fell off the horse. Not in a
> hundred years will I forget their words...

> ...I first noticed the signs. Little things, but for someone who grew up in
> these fields, it was obvious. The hay, usually bright and straight, was bent
> and dim. The little stream that came from the mountains was even smaller than
> it was yesterday. It didn't take long to notice the others knew it too. Faces
> grim, voices grave. Last harvest had been meager, all hopes had been on this
> one. They all knew it: a drought was coming, and by the looks of it, it was
> going to be a tough one.

Enter mob.

> ...Why are all those people up in arms? What do you mean, they don't like
> strangers? What does that mean? We're humble merchants, we don't mean anyone
> any harm! But the mob wasn't willing to listen to any of it. At the time, we
> had no idea what they were motivated by. All we knew is there were many of
> them, and for some reason, they weren't happy to see us in the slightest.

## Stranger

Enter stranger. 

> ...We have a customer! How can I help you, my cloaked friend? The strange 
> character that had just entered wasn't keen on showing their identity, that 
> much was clear. Hooded, masked, a dark cloak... his appearance alone gave me 
> the chills. And that voice - it's what I imagine a gravestone would sound, if 
> it could talk. A job is a job, so I addressed this strange fellow politely. 
> This was no customer, though. As if that graveyard voice wasn't concerning 
> enough, this is what he told us:

## Fire

Change temple into burning temple, fields into dry fields.

> ...The temple caught fire! Oh, no! That's not what I meant by seeing the light! 
> As I panicked and scrambled to run for water, I bounced into an elderly monk 
> who fell over, still yelling "Fire!" with his faint voice. It seems the gods 
> still look at us with *some* favour - a burning support beam fell down right 
> where the old monk would have been, had I not knocked him down. As I helped 
> him up, the flames started surrounding us. We made it through an opening, and 
> all the way out. Not everyone had been as lucky.

## Arrest

Enter the army. Move to dungeon.

> ...soldiers in the alley! Run! Yeah, back then we still thought we could run.
> They had all exits covered, of course. City guards had never been a match for 
> us, we'd thought ourselves masters of our domain. The army was seven steps 
> ahead of us at all times, they'd had us surrounded long before they showed 
> themselves. The alley, our escape routes, our safe houses, they had all been 
> sealed hermetically. They even had soldiers in the tunnels - there wasn't a 
> thing we could do as they dragged us to the dungeons, to tell us:

## Letter

Enter old Tony. 

> It's old Tony, looks like he's finished reading the letter. Oh, I didn't tell 
> you about the letter yet? We were cleaning out a room, like we sometimes have 
> to do to get our daily meal, when we found a very important-looking parchment. 
> None of us can read, of course, except old Tony. He served in the temple once, 
> though not for long. Long enough to learn almost all letters... He can't write 
> them, and reading doesn't go fast, but better than nothing, isn't it? Here he 
> comes... Why does he look so scared?
