# Stasis Cards

This is the “every day life” in which the story is set.

## The Scullion

- Start in the tavern, with a mop.
- Main goal: Do what they tell you (roll each turn).
- When rolling for a Theme includes [Glory](0_Theme.md#glory), re-roll if the 
  initial result was different.

> When they say "clean", we clean. We do what they tell us, and they feed us for
> it. We're the lowest in the hierarchy of the staff in this tavern, and they
> sure love to remind us of that. Such is life, I suppose... We never had much,
> we'll never have much. Born a low-life, die a low-life, is that it? Can there
> not be any glory for us? Travelers from afar sometimes talk about lowborns who
> became generals and even rulers. Are those just stories? We can dream, can't
> we? Wait, look there...

  if the initial result was different.

> Life on the farm had never been easy. "If you wanted an easy life, you should
> have chosen a palace to be born in, not a barn", old Grump always said. Well,
> it may have been hard work, but boy was it a satisfying life. Newly laid eggs
> in the morning, fresh vegetables in the evening and all the fruits you could
> eat in between. Their little farming community may have been poor, but they
> always had each other and what counted most: they were happy. I just got back
> from an errand, when...

  the initial result was different.

> We survive, that's what we do. How we do it, we don't care. Scruples are for
> the dead - if we have to steal or kill to survive, we'll steal or kill. Mostly
> we beg, though. So long as they give us what we need to survive, we won't have
> to use our... other means. We'd love to make an honest living, truly! We just  
> can't: look at us! Who'd hire us? One look at our scars, our missing limbs, or
> the traces of the hot iron they use for branding us, and their minds are made
> up. Hey, look there, ...

  Evil](0_Theme.md#good--evil), re-roll if the initial result was different.

> I'm an orphan. My parents have faded from my memory a long, long time ago. The
> good people of this temple took me in, when everyone else refused me. My mind
> was shrouded in darkness for the longest time, but I'm starting to see the
> light. The monks have been great teachers to us. Many of them are orphans,
> just like us. Taken in by the temple a long time ago, they now provide healing
> and guidance to anyone who needs it. A better example couldn't be hoped for.
> But what's this? Oh gods, ...

> Have I seen many places? Sweet child, name a town, any town, and we've been
> there. We live on the road, traveling from place to place with this cart and
> these goods. This village is just a short stop on a long road; the horses need
> rest and frankly, so do I... We left early this morning, and traveled far -
> we've not encountered a single soul all day. As you understand, learning it'd
> be market day tomorrow was quite a relief. Wow, hey, did you see that? Over

> nobility, most have their own blacksmiths in service anyways. It happens,
> though! Just the other day, we had the honour of serving a viscount. Just

> that? Oh, it seems like...
