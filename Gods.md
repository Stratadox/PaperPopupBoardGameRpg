# Gods

The Naï'ru had been at war with the Kralán since they had first encountered each
other, which was in the very beginning of the first intergalactic expansion of
both civilisations.

It started at the first extra-planetary colony... If they hadn't had the very
same planet as first colonisation target, at about the same time, the history of
this galaxy might have been completely different.

With a front line as massive as this one, spanning so many planets over dozens
of solar systems, neither the Naï'ru nor the Kralán could commit their forces in
such a way to have some of their own at each planet at all times. Instead, each
would supply the border-planets with forces from their colonised planets.

## Our planet

The planet our game takes place on is but a tiny and relatively insignificant
one - it had been the scene of a minor skirmish a long time ago, but nothing of
intergalactic importance has happened since.

The Kralán own most of it, turned it into a slave colony that produces weapons
for their Munde Moné attack dogs. The Naï'ru have some outposts there (one of
which is the kingdom in which our game plays out) which they prefer to keep...
if they'd be lost to the enemy, though, it would probably be a nuisance at most.

## Kralán / Munde Moné

The Kralán held control over a significant portion of the planet. While not very
rich in technolium, which they relied on most, the planet did have an abundance
of magicori. While the Kralán themselves didn't have much use for magicori, 
their subjects at their colony #23255 (locals call it "Munde Moné" or "Our home") 
have the ability to channel it into a fearsome power that could challenge the 
most skilled Naï'ru power suit warriors.

For this reason, the Kralán had turned their part of the planet into a slave
colony ruled by those of Munde Moné. These "demons", as they came to be known,
guard the borders of the colony and keep the slave subjects at bay.

## Naï'ru / Gordelins

Naï'ru forces, having successfully held on to most of their colonies on the
planet against overwhelming odds, realized very well that their victories where
mostly won by the grace of the Gordelins, their longtime allies.

While relatively minor allies to the Naï'ru, the Gordelins were masters of their 
own domain. Nobody had ever been able to conquer Gordelins Belt, "the Gordel", 
which the Gordelin home planet is part of, except for the Gordelins themselves. 
That was at home... Elsewhere, they usually had less success. 

Gordelins weren't as technologically advanced, as wise or as powerful as the
Naï'ru by any means. Their entire army would have a tough time dealing with a
mere scouting force of the Kralán. In most other scenarios, they relied on their
Naï'ru allies to keep them safe. On this planet, that was a different story.

At the time when the game starts, a Gordelin proposal for additional spending on
the project is being reviewed by a Naï'ru task force. Unless something radical
happens somewhere, it's heading for a refusal. 

## Impact

The local population doesn't know much of this whole intergalactic conflict - 
they're not even close to the kind of technology that lets them observe other 
galaxies, let alone travel to them or have any kind of impact.

They feel its consequences. though. The kingdom our players start out in, is an 
unimportant outpost even by Gordelin standards. 
Munde Moné rulers see this differently, and started to capitalize on the reduced 
garrison of the Gordelin protectors.

While minor for the Gordelin and Munde Moné, and ignored completely by both 
Naï'ru and Kralán, the tiny power shift has an enormous impact on our players. 

Demons suddenly appear much closer to the city than they ever dared to. The dark 
shadow that corrupts the spirit and enforces the worst of instincts, which their 
presence inevitably induces, has taken a seemingly permanent hold on the region.

To our players and the world as they perceive it, this means more chaos, terror 
and destruction than they had ever seen. The legends of old suddenly became more 
relevant than the occasional bedtime story they had been for so long.
